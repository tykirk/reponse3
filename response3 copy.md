# Reading Response the Third
## Words by Tyler Kirk

"Please stop sending me your word documents" by Marc Scott promotes the theme that when Microsoft Word is used, it undermines more practical, impactful technicalities. Notably, the program forces users to utilize MS Office in the case that they wish to open up a .docx file. Auxiliary processes are not without barriers, those who wish to open up .docx files without Word are forced into inconvenience. The last line of the article stood out to me:

"Perhaps you could save the file as a .txt, .rtf or PDF. Just spare a thought for those of us that choose not to use Microsoft Word, and respect our right not to do so"

I had not thought of word processing in any other context, but it makes sense for it to be treated this way. "Why Microsoft Word Must Die" brings up similar sentiments, reminding readers of the technical failures that Word allows. Besides messages established by Marc Scott, Charlie Stross mentions in his article about how Word also limits the technical experience users could absorb as they navigate word processing. I found Stross's ideas on the use of the program particularly articulate: "Its interface is convoluted, baroque, making the easy difficult and the difficult nearly impossible to achieve." Looking back this is definitely the case. There was a strong learning curve to becoming skilled with Word, regrettably so.

Markdown stands as a small solution to this animosity to Word, and Erik Martin describes it well in "Markdown: Markup That's Downright Simple." Impressively, Markdown bears a characteristic that Word is yet to achieve:

"Like other types of markup language, Markdown provides a simple means of adding additional information (tagging and metadata) to text so that it can be easily translated to HTML, XHTML, and other formats using built-in plain text formatting syntax."

This is a key point in the text, especially to those unfamiliar with the beauty of Markdown. "Guide to Podcasting" by Vanessa Quirk shifts focus from Word to podcasting as a possibly developing media platform. I have listened to a few podcasts in my time, and I believe my friends have largely done the same, but I never imagined podcasts to rise to the level of other multi-media outlets. It stood out to me what Quirk notes that "While Serial generated much media attention, it did not prompt a spike in podcast audience growth, which has remained steady for years. However, Serial did result in increased interest from advertisers and publishers looking to enter this space." Perhaps the next big podcast show will be able to break that wall, and not only gain the attention of advertisers, but also the attention of new market share and audiences.

Finally we have the podcasting timeline, which outlined that interesting and surprisingly complicated history of RSS feed. It's real purpose in context to our studies is to highlight how it operates along the lines of podcasting. The headline "This American Life is Made Freely Available As A Podcast" hits home a little for me because of how much I've heard stories from their channel, and how interesting it is that they found their roots in such a realm.

I was left with three key questions:

1.  How else is Microsoft Word perceived as a barrier to development? I was unaware of this idea.
2. Will there ever be a replacement for Microsoft Word?
3. Do podcasts have the potential to attract bigger businesses for broader markets?
